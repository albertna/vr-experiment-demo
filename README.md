# vr-experiment-demo

A demo on basic ideas for creating VR experiments in Unity. To run this project, clone the repo and open it in [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download). It will prompt you to install the right version of Unity Editor.

Designed to run on Meta Quest 2s.

Experiment session files are stored as Google Sheets in a public Google Drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mZGJNaC4ZOVtrjnaKs95KLyTEQ2fw8ln?usp=sharing). You can add/modify files in this folder as part of the demo session.

Feel free to use this as a template for your own projects. When you do, remember to use your own Google API key.
